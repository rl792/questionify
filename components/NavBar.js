        Create a new page at /app/home to be the Instructor Home Page.
        This page should only be visible by signed in users.
        If a signed-out user tries to access the page, they should
        be redirected to the login page to complete signing in.

        The Instructor Home Page should have 2 parts, similar to your 
        wireframe.
        1. The page should contain one section to display a short form
        allowing them to create a class code by making a 
        POST /api/class-codes (Completed in step 3a). When a class code has been created, this 
        page should re-fetch the user's class codes.
        
        2. The page should contain another section to display a list or
        table of the user's class codes. When the page loads for the first
        time, make a GET /api/class-codes (Completed in step 3a) to fetch the list of class codes.

              Finish configuring NextAuth by editing pages/api/auth/[...nextAuth].js.
              Then get the user's session and check if they are signed in.
              https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#usesession

              Display a button here to "Sign In" in if the user is not currently signed in,
              i.e they don't have an active session. It should send the user to /api/auth/signin
              https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin

              If the user is signed in and they have an active session, the button 
              should display "Sign out", and it should direct the user to the /api/auth/signout page
