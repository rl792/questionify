/*
CS5356 TODO 2b. API Tests

Pre-req: `database.test.mjs` & `login.test.mjs` should be passing before working
on this integration test.

Run `npm run test-class-codes` to test this file.

Below are integration tests that make requests to a running 
NextJS server, to test all the APIs to manage Class Codes.

To get these to pass, add APIs to `pages/api/` to respond to 
these requests. Use the user's server side session to check 
if they are signed in. And import the db from `services/database.mjs`
to get access to the data.

Read through each test to understand what it is trying to do,
and what is expected.
